Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your check-ins' content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required for the check-ins that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to sign off on your check-in each week (before the deadline); typically you should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.

# Check-In #1 - March 1, 2024

## Current Project Ideas

Several ideas for projects are currently being explored:

- Automatic test case generation:
  - Examine the control flow through a function / series of functions and determine the test cases required to reach all branches.
  - It looks like this idea can become complicated very quickly, so we may need to define a narrow scope for this project or it may not be feasible to complete within 6 weeks.
- Deadlock determination:
  - Follow the control flow through a multi-threaded program and determine if at any point it may reach a deadlock scenario.
  - There are some academic papers on this topic which we may be able to reference when building it out.

## Follow-Up Tasks

- Continue to come up with ideas for projects.
- Speak with the TA / Alex / Caroline about the ideas and decide on one to pursue.
- Define the scope of the project and distribute the work to each of the group members.
